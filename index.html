    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>First rule</h3>
      <p> The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet.<br> If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops dribbling, the player must only move one foot.<br> The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot.</p>

    <h2 style="color: plum;">Defensive rules</h2>
    <div class="subsection">
      <h3>First rule</h3>
      <p>The team on defense is the team without the basketball:<br>
        The main rule for the defensive player is not to foul. A foul is described as gaining an unfair advantage through physical contact. There is some interpretation that has to be made by the referee, but, in general, <strong>the defensive player may not touch the offensive player in a way that causes the offensive player to lose the ball or miss a shot</strong>
        </p> 

      <h3>Second rule</h3>
      <p><em>In some leagues you cannot stand for more than 3 seconds bellow the rim</em></p>
